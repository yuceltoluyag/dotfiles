2020-03-19 15:44:55	mpan	damoreno: not directly answering your question, but more like making the problem non-existent: stop expiring passwords. It’s an obsolete concept dating back long before computers were invented and having little use in the current age. It is also proven to effectively decrease security for most users. The current trend is to advise against it.

2020-03-19 15:47:24	mpan	steevo: only neglible portion of attacks have that form, so the benefit is minor. And the drawback is that it forces chosing weak passwords, promotes bad practices like writing down passwords on sticky notes etc.

2020-03-19 15:48:24	damoreno	steevo so far just the terminal. Fresh installation
2020-03-19 15:48:43	mpan	steevo: this is exactly the view that has dragged from the past centuries into the modern computer security without ever checking if such a situation is even happening.
2020-03-19 15:49:09	steevo	mpan, you're not wrong, but it is a balance. You can mitigate people from using weak passwords by using a password manager, so they only have to remember one or two passwords
2020-03-19 15:49:29	mingdao	I read the news article about hplip, and ran `pacman -Suy --overwrite /usr/share/hplip/\*` to perform the upgrade. Afterwards I got another warning about directory permissions https://0x0.st/imCn.txt which wasn't mentioned. Is there any need for intervention there?
2020-03-19 15:49:49	mpan	But most people do not use password manager. And still the benefit is minimal. It’s more like giving psychological comfort of pretending something is being done for security than actually being useful.

2020-03-19 15:52:41	damoreno	mpan in this case is an ansible playbook applied directly over a local machine to create the user. I find it more convenient to just set the password after. I could also just create a user without password and modify it afterwards. But I prefer to be reminded to do it when I login with the new account. In any other case, I agree with you

2021-04-16 18:07:00	Shapeshifter	I have a setup where I sometimes use headphones, sometimes my external amp and speakers. I needed to use an equalizer for the amp output to reduce bass. It took me forever to correctly configure alsa so this works: http://ix.io/2WiP Problem is, seems like some applications (steam?) cannot live without pulseaudio. But once I install pulseaudio, everything I configured in asound.conf seems to go out 
2021-04-16 18:07:06	Shapeshifter	the window. It's super hard to understand how to get pulseaudio to simply sit on top of the alsa default device. I want alsa to take care of the channel output (dmix) and equalizing. I just want pulse to not mess with that. btw I also tried pulseaudio-equalizer but it's slow, choppy and overall bad.

How do I get the memory to be managed freely up to 100%? What else can I do to look at the memory configuration and see where it is failing? It seems like a configuration error, because it can't be that it doesn't use all the memory.

2021-05-15 23:32:14	_tnk	I just found myself in a little pickle after a full system upgrade where X11 would not start properly. Or, seems like it started alright except for silently failing to do any screen output. nvidia drivers were of course part of the upgrade. Downgrading did not help. After a bit of fiddling I realized I had an xorg.conf generated by nvidia-xconfig. I wiped that, and suddenly my problems are gone. Does anyone know of 
2021-05-15 23:32:14	_tnk	any valid reason why I would want an xorg.conf at all, since X11 seems to do a better job of auto-detecting stuff than nvidia-xconfig does?

Running nvidia-xconfig might be how I "solved it" once upon a time. Basically, the screen randomly shows a 1-2 seconds old render of the screen. Guess I'm not done tweaking, but now I at least know where to look for the culprit.

2021-05-16 06:24:53	thurstylark	drl: you didn't answer the question. What DE are you using?
2021-05-16 06:25:04	a6a45081-2b83	thurstylark: what is the difference between aur/hadolint aur/hadolint-bin? second one is compile binary or binary with dlls?
2021-05-16 06:26:11	thurstylark	a6a45081-2b83: haskell packages can kind of be a pain on arch, so usually -bin packages for haskell stuff are statically linked so you don't have to pull all the haskell deps as well
2021-05-16 06:26:11	drl	thurstylark, I haven't installed a DE.
2021-05-16 06:26:13	SponiX	a6a45081-2b83: yes the -bin stands for "binary"
2021-05-16 06:26:29	thurstylark	drl: then what is in charge of showing you a graphical environment? That's the info we're after
2021-05-16 06:26:55	drl	thurstylark, Stumpwm.
2021-05-16 06:27:17	a6a45081-2b83	also I was wondering how PKGBUILD and .zst files work, do arch repo contains the compiled binary using PKGBUILD in .zst format?
2021-05-16 06:27:54	Edu4rdSHL	a6a45081-2b83, it doesn't contains "PKGBUILD in .zst format"

2021-05-16 06:28:25	Edu4rdSHL	They are binaries compressed in .zst format.
2021-05-16 06:29:05	Edu4rdSHL	Or better said, packages in .zst format.
2021-05-16 06:29:08	thurstylark	PKGBUILD is a recipe for making a package. The package is then compressed with zst
2021-05-16 06:29:24	thurstylark	the package is the meat and potatoes, and can be compressed in whatever format pacman supports
2021-05-16 06:30:08	a6a45081-2b83	source files -> PKGBUILD -> package -> compressed -> .zst?

2021-05-16 06:30:32	a6a45081-2b83	so the arch repo contains .zst? therefore I don't have to compile anything?
2021-05-16 06:30:39	Edu4rdSHL	y
2021-05-16 06:30:43	a6a45081-2b83	some packages do compile however...
2021-05-16 06:30:57	sheep	only ones from the AUR
2021-05-16 06:30:59	thurstylark	a6a45081-2b83: be specific. Which ones?

2021-05-16 10:56:24	ichernev	ok, yesterday (or 2 days ago) I had the problem of xfce4's keyboard layout configuration not applying, so I resorted to writing a xorg.conf file with the layouts. Now I figured out the problem (maybe). It turns out the layout indicator on the panel does some of the work. Also, the actual "settings" are stored in root X window (can be examined with xprop -root | grep '_XKB_RULES_NAMES'). I removed indicator and x11.conf
2021-05-16 10:56:24	ichernev	but it still works :-/ If I do another fresh install I might investigate further :)

2021-05-16 11:19:13	graphitemaster	I'm having problems updating my installation due to an unknown trust PGP signature in some of my packages. I've populated the pacman keyring and refreshed them manually with pacman-key --refresh-keys and I'm still having problems

2021-05-16 11:23:36	graphitemaster	That's the other thing, when I try to update keys the output I get each time is the same, like it isn't taking.
2021-05-16 11:23:51	graphitemaster	I ran that hundreds of times now and the output is always the same (disables a bunch of keys, and enables others)
2021-05-16 11:23:54	graphitemaster	And it's always the same keys.
2021-05-16 11:23:59	graphitemaster	It's like the file is not being written.

2021-05-16 11:24:46	sheep	installing the new version of archlinux-keyring should fix it
2021-05-16 11:25:17	graphitemaster	I did that too. I should add I ran pacman -S archlinux-keyring multiple times even, the output is always the same.

2021-05-16 11:25:43	ichernev	ok, actually there is a bug in the xfce4-settings Arch package. If I compile xfce4-settings from source the deault is "use system settings" and the keyboard layout works
2021-05-16 11:25:58	sheep	graphitemaster:  what's the full output with the error messages?

2021-05-16 11:27:34	graphitemaster	sheep, Oh you know what, I had to do _both_ by the looks of it, it wasn't enough to just pacman -S archlinux-keyring, I had to also pacman-kkey --refresh-keys
2021-05-16 11:27:47	graphitemaster	Since well the packages passed the test this time

2021-05-16 11:32:25	graphitemaster	ichernev, I use a cutting edge distribution because I actually find myself needing newer packages (mainly compilers *ARGH*) and well, the next best thing to Arch is probably Debian for me but those people cannot seem to stay up to date on packages. Also this Arch installation I've had since 2008, moved it physically (drive) wise into three separate system upgrades and it still works!
2021-05-16 11:33:38	graphitemaster	So a combination of those two things and finding that Arch is insanely stable even for long upgrade intervals basically sealed the fate at this point.
2021-05-16 11:33:51	graphitemaster	I hate installing Linux, takes me months to setup correctly.
2021-05-16 11:33:52	ichernev	graphitemaster: I know the benefits of cutting-edge distributions, that is why I use arch. But if you install something that just came out (any package in the repo), not updating it means somewhat serious security implications. Esp true for kernel
