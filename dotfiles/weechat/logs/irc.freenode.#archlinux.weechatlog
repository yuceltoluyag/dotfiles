2020-03-19 15:44:55	mpan	damoreno: not directly answering your question, but more like making the problem non-existent: stop expiring passwords. It’s an obsolete concept dating back long before computers were invented and having little use in the current age. It is also proven to effectively decrease security for most users. The current trend is to advise against it.

2020-03-19 15:47:24	mpan	steevo: only neglible portion of attacks have that form, so the benefit is minor. And the drawback is that it forces chosing weak passwords, promotes bad practices like writing down passwords on sticky notes etc.

2020-03-19 15:48:24	damoreno	steevo so far just the terminal. Fresh installation
2020-03-19 15:48:43	mpan	steevo: this is exactly the view that has dragged from the past centuries into the modern computer security without ever checking if such a situation is even happening.
2020-03-19 15:49:09	steevo	mpan, you're not wrong, but it is a balance. You can mitigate people from using weak passwords by using a password manager, so they only have to remember one or two passwords
2020-03-19 15:49:29	mingdao	I read the news article about hplip, and ran `pacman -Suy --overwrite /usr/share/hplip/\*` to perform the upgrade. Afterwards I got another warning about directory permissions https://0x0.st/imCn.txt which wasn't mentioned. Is there any need for intervention there?
2020-03-19 15:49:49	mpan	But most people do not use password manager. And still the benefit is minimal. It’s more like giving psychological comfort of pretending something is being done for security than actually being useful.

2020-03-19 15:52:41	damoreno	mpan in this case is an ansible playbook applied directly over a local machine to create the user. I find it more convenient to just set the password after. I could also just create a user without password and modify it afterwards. But I prefer to be reminded to do it when I login with the new account. In any other case, I agree with you
